                    <h2>Persian Art</h2>
                    <p>
                        The art of Iran encompasses many disciplines, including architecture, stonemasonry, metalworking, weaving, pottery, painting, and calligraphy. Iranian works of art show a great variety in style, in different regions and periods. The art of the Medes remains obscure, but has been theoretically attributed to the Scythian style. The Achaemenids borrowed heavily from the art of their neighboring civilizations, but produced a synthesis of a unique style, with an eclectic architecture remaining at sites such as Persepolis and Pasargadae. Greek iconography was imported by the Seleucids, followed by the recombination of Hellenistic and earlier Near Eastern elements in the art of the Parthians, with remains such as the Temple of Anahita and the Statue of the Parthian Nobleman. By the time of the Sasanians, Iranian art came across a general renaissance. Although of unclear development, Sasanian art was highly influential, and spread into far regions. Taq-eBostan, Taq-e-Kasra, Naqsh-eRostam, and the Shapur-Khwast Castle are among the surviving monuments from the Sasanian period.<br>
                        During the Middle Ages, Sasanian art played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval art, which carried forward to the Islamic world, and much of what later became known as Islamic learning—including medicine, architecture, philosophy, philology, and literature—were of Sasanian basis.<br>
                        The Safavid era is known as the Golden Age of Iranian art, and Safavid works of art show a far more unitary development than in any other period, as part of a political evolution that reunified Iran as a cultural entity. Safavid art exerted noticeable influences upon the neighboring Ottomans, the Mughals, and the Deccans, and was also influential through its fashion and garden architecture on 11th-17th-century Europe.<br>
                        Iran's contemporary art traces its origins back to the time of Kamalol-Molk, a prominent realist painter at the court of the Qajar dynasty who affected the norms of painting and adopted a naturalistic style that would compete with photographic works. A new Iranian school of fine art was established by Kamal-olMolk in 1928, and was followed by the so-called "coffeehouse" style of painting Qajar dynasty rock reliefs in Tangeh Savashi, of the Fath Ali Shah era, c. 1800 Star-tile, Kashan, 13-14th century Half of a "Salting carpet", Safavid, in wool, silk and metal thread, about 1600 Persian art or Iranian art has one of the richest art heritages in world history and has been strong in many media including architecture, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, metalworking and sculpture. At different times, influences from the art of neighbouring civilizations have been very important, and latterly Persian art gave and received major influences as part of the wider styles of Islamic art. From the Achaemenid Empire of 550 BC-330 BC for most of the time a large Iranian-speaking state has ruled over areas similar to the modern boundaries of Iran, and often much wider areas, sometimes called Greater Iran, where a process of cultural Persianization left enduring results even when the predomination was separated. The courts of successive dynasties have generally led the style of Persian art, and court sponsored art has left many of the most impressive survivals.<br>

                    <h2>Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        The earliest attested cultures in Iran date back to the Lower Paleolithic. Owing to its geopolitical position. Iran has influenced cultures as far as Greece and Italy to the west, Russia to the north, the Arabian Peninsula to the south, and south and east Asia to the east. Farsi, the official language of Iran, is historically one of the most prominent languages of the Middle East and extended regions. Iranian culture is one of the oldest in the Middle East region, and it has influenced cultures like Italy, Macedonia, Greece, Russia, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. Islam is practiced by the majority of Iranians and governs their personal, political, economic and legal lives. The Persian calendar is a solar calendar, however, some of the official religious Islamic and Shia holidays are based on a lunar calendar.<br>

                    <h5>Cultural life  </h5>
                    <p>
                        Few countries enjoy such a long cultural heritage as does Iran, and few people are so aware of and articulate about their deep cultural tradition as are the Iranians. Iran, or Persia, as a historical entity, dates to the time of the Achaemenids (about 2,500 years ago), and, despite political, religious, and historic changes, Iranians maintain a deep connection to their past. Although daily life in modern Iran is closely interwoven with Shiite Islam, the country's art, literature, and architecture are an ever-present reminder of its deep national tradition and of a broader literary culture that during the early modern period spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia. <br>
                        Despite the predominance of Persian culture, Iran remains a multiethnic state, and the country's Armenian Azerbāijān. Kurdish, and smaller ethnic minorities each have their own literary and historical traditions dating back many centuries, even - in the case of the Armenians to the pre-Christian era. These groups frequently maintain close connections with the larger cultural life of their kindred outside Iran.<br>

                    <h3>Persian Events, Customs, Traditions, Festivals & Celebrations </h3>
                    <p>
                        Nowrouz (The New Year's Eve) Iran's official New Year begins with Nowruz, an ancient Iranian tradition celebrated annually on the vernal equinox. It is enjoyed by people adhering to different religions, but is considered a holiday for the Zoroastrians. It was registered on the UNESCO's list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2009, described as the Persian New Year, shared with a number of other countries in which it has historically been celebrated.<br>
                        When the Sun reaches the vernal equinox on the meridian, the 20th or 21st of March, days and nights are approximately equal. This very same day has long been called Nowruz ("now" means new and "ruz" means day). Since thousands of years ago, Iranians knew this and regarded it as the first day of the New Year in Iranian solar calendar. The first mythical king, Jamshid, is said to have celebrated this occasion as the beginning of his establishing justice and defeating demons. To celebrate Nowruz, there are some preparatory traditions observed by Iranians like: last Wednesday feast (firecrackers, etc.), deceased day and the last Thursday (Honoring the Deceased in the cemeteries, etc.), khaneh-tekani (house cleaning, etc.), cereal planting, haft-seen (special combination of symbolic stuff at everyone's home), new clothes, Nowruz dishes, visiting each other, the first Nowruz, its presents, its post cards. Sizdah-Beh-Dar (national day for picnicking) and so forth.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Haft-Seen</h5>
                    <p>
                        Also spelled as Haft Sin (the seven seen's) is a tabletop (sofreh) or (Haft Miveh, the seven fruits) arrangement of seven symbolic items traditionally displayed at Nowruz, the Iranian new year. The haft-seen table includes seven items all starting with the letter Seen (Persian letter ww) in the Persian alphabet.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Haji Firouz </h5>
                    <p>
                        Is a fictional character in Iranian folklore who appears in the streets by the beginning of Nowruz. His face is covered in soot, and he is clad in bright red clothes and a felt hat. He dances through the streets while singing and playing a tambourine.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Sizdah Bedar</h5>
                    <p>
                        Millions of Iranians spend outdoors on the final day of celebrations for the New Year holidays. The term Sizdah Bedar literally means "out with the thirteenth”. To Iranians, the number "13" symbolizes evil and bad luck. The annual "Sizdah Bedar” picnic is based on an ancient Iranian tradition that encourages people to avoid any ill omens at home by going outdoors on the 13th day of the new year. This day inaugurates a happy New Year. In Iranian tradition, the first 12 days of the new year symbolize order in the world and in people's lives. The 13th day marks the return to ordinary daily life. In one of the traditions, young ladies tie together blades of grass in hope of finding their ideal husbands. The gesture represents the bond between a man and a woman.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Festival of Fire or Char-Shanbeh Souri (Wednesday festival)</h5>
                    <p>
                        On the eve of the last Wednesday of the preceding year, as a prelude to Nowruz, the ancient festival of Chär-Shanbeh Souri celebrates Atash (fire) by performing rituals such as jumping over bonfires and lighting off firecrackers and fireworks. The Nowruz celebrations last by the end of the 13th day of the Iranian year (Farvardin 13, usually coincided with April 1 or 2), celebrating the festival of Sizdah-bedar, during which the people traditionally go outdoors to picnic. The Festival of Fire sees bonfires sprouting up in various public areas and parks. People jump over the burning cinders and shout, "Give me your red color and take back sickly pallor” which is a purification ritual. Many Iranians believe their ancestors' spirits visit during the last few days of the year.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Yalda Night (Shab-e Chelleh)</h5>
                    <p>
                        Yaldā, another nationally celebrated ancient tradition, commemorates the ancient goddess Mithra and marks the longest night of the year on the eve of the winter solstice (December 20 or 21), during which families gather together to recite poetry and eat fruits- particularly the red fruits watermelon and pomegranate, as well as mixed nuts.<br>
